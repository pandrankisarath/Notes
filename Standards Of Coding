1.High Availability:
It involves using Java frameworks and technologies to build systems that can withstand failures and maintain operational continuity.

2.Auto Scaling:
Autoscaling means dynamically adjusting the number of JVM instances, which can be achieved using cloud-based auto-scaling services or container orchestration tools.

3.Resiliency:
resiliency refers to the ability of a system, network, or application to maintain functionality and recover quickly from failures, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions. This often involves redundancy, backups, and disaster recovery planning.

4.Observability:
Observability refers to the ability to measure, understand, and infer the internal state of a system
Some of the tools used are: Tools like Elasticsearch, Kibana.

5.Monitoring:
 It mainly involves tracking the performance, availability, and security of computer systems, networks, applications, and services. It helps identify issues, ensure optimal performance, and prevent or quickly address potential problems.

6.Loggs:
logs are records that capture information about events and activities within a Java application or system.Utilizing logging frameworks such as Log4j or SLF4J to generate logs at different levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.

7.RTO - Recovery Time Objective
It means the maximum allowable time for the recovery of a system after a failure or disaster.

8.RPO - Recovery Point Objective
 It helps organizations define the acceptable level of data loss they can tolerate and guides the development of strategies to ensure data recovery within the specified timeframe in the event of a disruption.

9.Return on Investment (ROI):
 For assessing the success of investments, projects, marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. It provides a standardized measure that can be used to compare the profitability of different investments.which defines profit or loss of the bussiness.
